# Pathfinding Visualizer

This project is intended to show a visualizing of how pathfinding algorithms work.
Users can compare each algorithm and follow along with the algorithm so they can have a better understanding. 


# Algorithms
Several pathfinding algorithms are implemented including A*star, Dijkstra's, Greedy, Breadth First Search, and Depth First Search.

# Stack
The project was built using React, TypeScript and SASS.

I also used Create React App to create the project, and FontAwesome for icons.
